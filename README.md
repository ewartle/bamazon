In this class project, I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL, Node, Express, and Inquirer.  

The app has three components.  The first relates to the customer.  In this mode, the customer interacts with a products database and has the option to identify the item it wants to purchase and the quantity.  The app then confirms that the desired number is in stock and returns a message to the user.  

In the second component, the app interfaces with a manager and the products database, allowing a manager to add items, check inventory, and add inventory.  

The third component relates to a supervisor and utlizes a second database--the departments database-- in mySQL. It allows a superviser to check total sales and profits for individual departments and add new departments.  

Thank you for your interest in this application.
