In this class project, I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL, Node, Express, and Inquirer.  

The app has three components.  The first relates to the customer.  In this mode, the customer interacts with a products database and has the option to identify the item it wants to purchase and the quantity.  The app then confirms that the desired number is in stock and returns a message to the user.  In addition, this component will update the quantity in stock and product sales.  

In the second component, the app interfaces with a manager and the products database, allowing a manager to (1) view all items in stock (including the product name, the department name, the quantity in stock, and the product sales for each item), (2) add new items, (3) check low inventory, and (4) add inventory.  

The third component relates to a supervisor and utlizes a second database--the departments database-- in mySQL. It allows a superviser to view all departments, the total sales for each department, and the total profits for each department.  In addition, the supervisor can add a new department.    

Thank you for your interest in this application.
