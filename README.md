In this class project, I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL, Node, Express, and Inquirer.  The app includes two databases:  (1) a products database and (2) a department database.  

The app has three interfaces.  The first relates to the customer.  In this interface, the customer interacts with a products database and has the option to identify the item the customer wants to purchase and the quantity.  The app then confirms that the desired number is in stock and returns a message to the user, providing the user with the total cost of the purchase.  The app also updates the quantity in stock and product sales in the products database.  

In the second interface, the app engages with a manager.  Accessing the products database, the manager can (1) view all items in stock (including the product name, the department name, the quantity in stock, and the product sales for each item), (2) add new items, (3) check low inventory, and (4) add inventory.  Upon adding a new item or adding inventory, the manager can "view all products" and confirm that the database has been updated to reflect the manager's inputs.    

The third interface can be accessed by a Supervisor and utilizes the departments database.  This database allows the supervisor to view all departments, the total sales for each department (by combining product sales for each item in a given department), and the total profits for each department.  In addition, the supervisor can add a new department.    

Here is a link to a video demonstration of the app:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UXxq7sUcfWW2HFqd7NMyyfHhKBiRccav?usp=sharing

Thank you for your interest in this application.
